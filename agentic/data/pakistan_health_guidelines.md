# Pakistan Primary Care Quick Reference (derived from contest PDF)

## Fever & Respiratory Illness
- Viral fevers usually respond to rest, hydration, and paracetamol. Escalate if temperature >39 °C (child) or >38.5 °C lasting >3 days.
- Dry cough persisting beyond three weeks, with chest pain or blood, should be reviewed at a hospital emergency department.
- For influenza-like illness, recommend fluids, salt-water gargles, and vapour rubs. Remind families that antibiotics do not treat viral flu.

## Gastrointestinal Concerns
- Diarrhoea with vomiting: stabilise hydration first, then advance to oral rehydration solutions. Seek urgent care if liquids cannot be kept down or urine output stops for 8+ hours.
- Constipation: increase fibre to 25 g/day, drink 1.5–2 L of water, and consider osmotic laxatives. Refer if symptoms persist longer than three months or are accompanied by fever, vomiting, or >10 lb weight loss.
- Vomiting with severe abdominal pain or suspected appendicitis requires immediate hospital referral.

## Ear, Nose, and Eye
- Conjunctivitis: cold compresses, artificial tears, and strict hygiene. Refer for known injuries, severe pain, or symptoms >10 days.
- Ear infections in children: give paracetamol/ibuprofen, avoid swimming, and refer if the child is <12 months or symptoms last >3 days.
- Sinusitis: rest, fluids, saline rinses, and analgesics. Refer if symptoms worsen after one week of pharmacy care or persist >3 weeks.

## Dermatology & Allergies
- Hives: antihistamines relieve itching; escalate if swelling affects lips/tongue or if breathing difficulty occurs (possible anaphylaxis).
- Allergic rhinitis: oral antihistamines, corticosteroid nasal sprays, and allergen avoidance. Refer for throat swelling or shortness of breath.

## Safety Flags
- Chest pain with shortness of breath, sudden neurological changes, or vomiting blood are emergencies.
- For UTIs, send to urgent care if the patient is pregnant, older than 65, immunocompromised, or develops confusion (possible sepsis).
- Severe headache with vision changes, high fever, or stiff neck warrants emergency evaluation for meningitis or stroke.
