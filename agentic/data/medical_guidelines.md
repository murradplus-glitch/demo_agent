# Virtual Care Clinical Snippets

## Diabetes and Infection
- Monitor fever patterns daily; temperature >38.5°C for 3 days warrants clinician review.
- Sustained blood glucose >180 mg/dL during illness increases dehydration risk; encourage hydration and glucose checks every 4 hours.
- Escalate if cough is accompanied by shortness of breath, chest pain, or oxygen saturation <94%.

## Respiratory Red Flags
- Red flag if cough lasts longer than 3 weeks, produces blood, or is paired with tachycardia.
- Adults with chronic conditions should seek urgent care when fever persists beyond 72 hours despite antipyretics.
- Virtual clinicians should advise same-day evaluation for diabetics reporting respiratory symptoms plus fever.

## Self-Care Guidance
- Recommend acetaminophen for fever unless liver disease present; avoid NSAIDs if kidney disease suspected.
- Encourage rest, hydration (2–3 liters/day), and humidified air.
- Provide return precautions: new wheezing, confusion, persistent vomiting, or inability to keep liquids down.
